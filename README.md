# chicken-sound-classification üêî
Hey! I'm Akhila. This project was something I worked on during the final semester of my master's, as part of a course called Generative AI. our professor just wanted us to explore something interesting and learn by doing. We could pick any algorithm and work on chicken sound classification.Working on this was fun and aslo it had real applications in smart farming.
# What‚Äôs this project about?
The goal was to classify different types of chicken sounds like distress calls, normal clucking, or roosters crowing using machine learning. I used audio data, extracted features from it, and built a basic classifier.
# Tools and Technolohies used:
Python

Librosa to extract MFCCs (features from audio)

Random Forest as my ML model

Google Colab to run everything

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
# How to run:
This project was built in Google Colab, so no setup is required on your local machine if you use the notebook.
Open the Colab notebook:
Upload your audio files
Run all cells
Explore the visualizations
#  What I learned:
How to work with audio data (which was new to me)

How sound can actually reflect emotion or behavior

The importance of preprocessing and feature selection

Most importantly: you don‚Äôt need a complex idea to learn something cool
